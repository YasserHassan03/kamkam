## 🚀 1. Getting Started

### Registration & Login
- **Sign Up**: Create an account using your email. 
- **Organisation Profile**: Your first step is to create an **Organisation**. This is your "Brand" (e.g., "London Ramadan League"). Every tournament you create will be linked to this brand, displaying your logo and name.

## 🏗️ 2. Setting Up Your Tournament

### Create a Tournament
Inside your Organisation, you can host multiple tournaments (e.g., "Ramadan 2026", "Eid 2026").
1.  **Basic Info**: Set the name, year, and venue.
2.  **Scoring Rules**: Set your points for a Win/Draw/Loss.
3.  **Automated Tie-Breaks**: Kam Kam automatically applies standard fair play rules (Goal Difference, Goals For, etc.) to settle any level points in the standings.
4.  **Format**: Choose between **League**, **Knockout**, or a **Group + Knockout** hybrid.

### Team & Player Management
- **Add Teams**: Create teams with custom logos and primary/secondary colors.
- **Roster Management**: 
    - You can add players to each team with their **Name** and **Jersey Number**.
    - **Pro Tip**: Even if you don't have players yet, you can still run live matches and just update the score (Score-only mode).

## ⚽ 4. Match Day: Live Control

The **Live Match Control** is your digital scoreboard. It provides real-time updates to everyone's phones.

### Running a Match
1.  Navigate to your tournament and tap an active match.
2.  **Start Match**: This turns the match "LIVE" for everyone watching the app.
3.  **Recording Goals**: 
    - Tap the team who scored.
    - Select the player from the dropdown (or skip if not using names).
    - Hit **Add Goal**.
    - The app automatically updates the score, the clock, and the player's personal goal tally.
4.  **End Match**: Once finished, the result is locked and the standings are updated instantly.

### Manual Backups
If you made a mistake or a match wasn't recorded live:
- You can manually edit any match result in the admin list.
- You can manually adjust a player's goal count in their team roster, and the **Golden Boot** standings will update immediately.
